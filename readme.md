# Laravel 4 w/ Vagrant - Global Box

A basic Ubuntu 12.04 Vagrant setup with [Laravel4](http://laravel.com/docs) and PHP 5.5.

## Requirements

* VirtualBox - Free virtualization software [Download Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Vagrant **1.3+** - Tool for working with virtualbox images [Download Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
* Git - Source Control Management [Download Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Setup

* Clone this repository `git clone http://github.com/bryannielsen/Laravel4-Vagrant.git`
* (the first time you run vagrant it will need to fetch the virtual box image which is ~300mb so depending on your download speed this could take some time)
* Vagrant will then use puppet to provision the base virtual box with our LAMP stack (this could take a few minutes) 

*Note: You may have to change permissions on the www/app/storage folder to 777 under the host OS* 

For example: `chmod -R 777 www/app/storage/`

## Usage

Some basic information on interacting with the vagrant box

### Fabric Commands

All the fabric commands need to be prefixed with `fab vagrant`, for example `fab vagrant composer` will run a composer update.

* `composer:'comand string'` - This will run the composer command that you request. Ex: `fab vagrant composer:'install'`
* `artisan:'command string'` - Similar to above but for artisan commands. Ex: `fab vagrant artisan:'migate'`
* `setProject:projectname` - Set the project folder to be the specified name in the parent folder.
* `restoreDb` - restore the current projects last database dump
* `backupDb` - Backup the current project's database

### Port Forwards

* 8888 - Apache
* 8889 - MySQL 
* 5433 - PostgreSQL


### Default MySQL/PostgreSQL Database

* User: root
* Password: (blank)
* DB Name: database


### PHPmyAdmin

Accessible at http://localhost:8888/phpmyadmin using MySQL access credentials above.

### PHP XDebug

XDebug is included in the build but **disabled by default** because of the effect it can have on performance.  

To enable XDebug:

1. Set the variable `$use_xdebug = "1"` at the beginning of `puppet/manifests/phpbase.pp`
2. Then you will need to provision the box either with `vagrant up` or by running the command `vagrant provision` if the box is already up
3. Now you can connect to XDebug on **port 9001**

**XDebug Tools**

* [MacGDBP](http://www.bluestatic.org/software/macgdbp/) - Free, Mac OSX
* [Codebug](http://www.codebugapp.com/) - Paid, Mac OSX


_Note: All XDebug settings can be configured in the php.ini template at `puppet/modules/php/templates/php.ini.erb`_
